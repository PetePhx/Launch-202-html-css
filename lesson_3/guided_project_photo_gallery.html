      <ol>
        <li>
          After loading the page, you may notice that the images are vertically
          too near each other, and they're flush with the top and left edges of
          the window. Adjust the spacing between the figure elements and the
          distance between the left and right edges of the browser window to
          50px to give the images some breathing room.
        </li><br/>
        <li>
          Reduce your browser window's width, if necessary, until at least one
          image exceeds the window width. Next, adjust the CSS to make them all
          fit inside the window. Don't forget that there is a margin around each
          figure, which should be evident when you display the page.
        </li>
        <p>
          Once your changes are complete, check what happens as you expand and
          shrink the browser window; no matter what adjustments you make, all
          images should fit in the window.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Answer: after setting the `img` max-width to 100%, when shrinking the
          window horizontally the images shrink in size to fit the width of the
          parent element `figure`.</em>
        </p>
        <li>
          Every image should use the entire width of the figure elements. Modify
          your CSS to implement this requirement.
        </li></br>
        <p>
          <em>Answer: we replace `max-width: 100%;` with `width: 100%;` for
            `img`.</em>
        </p>
        <li>
          Reduce the width of each figure to 1/2 the width of the browser window:
        </li>
        <p>
          <em>The width property for `figure` is set to 50%.</em>
        </p>
        <li>
          At this point, the figures are narrow enough that we should be able to
          squeeze 2 of them in every row on the page. However, since figures are
          block elements, they always take up an entire row. Instead, you must
          convert the figure elements to inline-block. Please do so.
        </li>
        <p>
          <em>Setting `display: inline-block;` for `figure`. The image width is
          set to 40% to accomodate the 50pixel wide left margin, while right
          margin is set to 0. We also comment out the blank space in html
          between consequetive `figure` elements to avoid the blank space
          character from being inserted.</em>
        </p>
        <li>
          There's a small cosmetic issue unrelated to squeezing two images per
          row. Let's center the captions beneath each image:
        </li>
        <p>
          <em>Set `text-align: center;` for `figure` elements.</em>
        </p>
        <li>
          Returning to the problem of squeezing two images per row, the main
          issue we have is that we have margins to the left and right of each
          figure. Recall that we used margins here to satisfy our rule of thumb
          about choosing margins or padding. However, those margins take up
          space in the browser window, so we can't squeeze two 50%-width
          elements side-by-side. Instead, we need to set the left and right
          margins on the figure elements to 0, and redistribute that space in
          some other way. Give this a try now.
        </li>
        <p>
          <em>we can do as in section 5 above, or set the left/right margins to 0 and
            apply the 50px size to left and right paddings, to have them absorbed
            in the border-box dimensions.</em>
        </p>
        <li>
          The other part of the problem of squeezing two images per row is that
          there is a small amount of whitespace between every pair of
          inline-block elements. It's not much whitespace, but it's enough to
          prevent two 50% elements from fitting side-by-side. Go ahead and make
          the necessary adjustments to get rid of the whitespace.
        </li>
        <p>
          <em>As in section 5 above, we use html commenting syntax &lt;--! ... --&gt;
            to void the html blank space between subsequent `figure` elements.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Alternatively, we could set the font-size to 0 for the main
            element to have the extra blanck space inserted occupy no space and
            then set the font-size back to original value for the child nodes.
          </em>
        </p>
        <li>
          The images are a bit on the small side. Let's give the user the
          ability to see them full-sized by clicking on them. When clicked, the
          browser should load the image directly into a new tab or window. To
          accomplish this, convert your images into links.
        </li>
        <p>
          <em>The `img` elements are wrappend within anchor `a` elements.
          </em>
        </p>
        <li>
          You can now get rid of the outline you attached to the figure elements,
          and assign a pleasant background to the gallery. You can use the
          background image we used earlier in this lesson
          (http://d3jtzah944tvom.cloudfront.net/202/images/lesson_3/gradient-background.png)
          or one of your own.
        </li>
        <p>
          <em>We set the background-image property for the body element to the
            above url. By setting the background-size to `cover` we avoid
            repetition in the background image.
          </em>
